Blind people are some of the unluckiest persons we can found in our society. They cannot taste the creation of the almighty. As we know, they use a blind stick for their movements. It is mainly used to detect objects by pushing them manually around them. But sometimes those hits can mismatch and cause 
damage. To prevent this, we are offering a modification to the existing one.
This is mainly used for Blind People. Normally the ordinary stick doesn’t detect any object which might 
block the user pathway. By this project we can detect object that might chock the user movement. With 
some modification it can be used for old aged people.
Here are some tools needed to complete the project. Like: 
• Arduino 
• Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 
• Alarming Speaker 
• Resistor 
• Blind Stick 
• Connecting Wires 
• Breadboard 
• Arduino IDE 
• APDS 9930

Limitation 
The sensor we are using has a range of 4 meter approximately. If an object is outside of this range, the 
user cannot take any precaution. For example, a busy road or an open path of the sewer. 

Challenge 
• It may appear difficult to set multiple electronics on a single stick. 
• We may face some power management issues.
